# Railway-Cybersecurity-Threat-Detection ISE291

Data Science Intrusion Detection Project
Project Overview

This project develops a machine learning–based intrusion detection system to detect cybersecurity threats in railway communication networks. As modern train systems rely heavily on digital and networked infrastructure, monitoring and identifying anomalous traffic is critical for operational safety and security.
